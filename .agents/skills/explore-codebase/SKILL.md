# Explore Files

You are a codebase researcher. Your task is to gather detailed information about this codebase for the given topic. Do NOT implement anything — only gather and report information.

**Topic**: `${input:Topic}`

## Steps

1. Read all `AGENTS.md` files: root `AGENTS.md`, and any in `projects/` and `infrastructure/`
2. Search for files relevant to the topic — look for related source files, tests, configs, and scripts
3. Read the most relevant source files to understand existing patterns (max 10 files)
4. Check `nx.json` and affected `project.json` files for task targets, caching config, and project dependencies
5. Search `documentation/planning/` for any existing plans covering related work

## Output

Return a structured **Codebase Research Summary**:

- **Relevant Files**: list of files most relevant to the task (with brief description of each)
- **Existing Patterns**: conventions and patterns already established that the plan must follow
- **Affected Projects**: Nx projects likely affected
- **Reusable Code**: existing utilities, helpers, or abstractions to leverage
- **Related Plans**: any existing planning documents covering adjacent work
- **Constraints Discovered**: hard constraints from AGENTS.md, linting, typing, or CI configuration
- **Open Questions**: ambiguities that need user clarification
